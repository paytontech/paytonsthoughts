# paytonsthoughts
This is the swift project (and thoughts) for my upcoming app, Payton's Thoughts! The .ipa file will be posted once I complete it! You can do literally whatever you want with this project! I DO NOT care if you edit this project in your own Xcode project to make me look bad!

This github repo shows all the source code I used to make this app. The app recieves my thoughts via the thoughts file in the main repo.
